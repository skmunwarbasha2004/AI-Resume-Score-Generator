# Hello
# AI Resume Analyzer üìù
The AI Resume Analyzer is an intelligent web-based tool designed to help job seekers evaluate and enhance their resumes by comparing them directly against a specific job description. Leveraging advanced AI models, this tool simulates how Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and recruiters assess your resume for relevance, alignment, and suitability for a role. Completely in a single Python file.

Watch our [Youtube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/XfoHr9GivCs) for a Demo and detailed explanation of installation steps and code.

## üîç What Does This Project Do?
### 1. Resume Text Extraction
Users upload their resumes in PDF format, and the system automatically extracts the raw text for further analysis.

### 2. Job Description Input
The user provides the job description for the position they are targeting. This sets the criteria against which the resume will be evaluated.

### 3. ATS Similarity Score
Using Sentence Transformers (BERT-based model), the tool calculates a similarity score between the resume and the job description. This score reflects how well the resume matches keywords, context, and requirements typically scanned by ATS software.

### 4. AI-Powered Resume Evaluation
With the help of Groq's Llama-based LLM, the tool generates a detailed, human-readable evaluation report. The AI analyzes various factors such as skills, experience, and qualifications, assigning a score (out of 5) for each aspect and using emojis (‚úÖ, ‚ùå, ‚ö†Ô∏è) to quickly highlight strengths and gaps.

### 5. Actionable Feedback
The AI not only scores your resume but also provides personalized suggestions on how to improve it, helping candidates refine their applications before submission.

### 6. Downloadable Report
Users can easily download the detailed analysis for reference, making it convenient to track and implement the suggested changes.
